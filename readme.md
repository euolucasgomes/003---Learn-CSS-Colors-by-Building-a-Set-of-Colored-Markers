Module 003 - Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers

In this FreeCodeCamp project, I focused on mastering CSS colors by creating a set of colored markers. The project allowed me to explore various aspects of CSS and HTML, applying these to design an interactive and visually engaging set of markers.

Key HTML Elements Used:

*Heading Elements "h1": For the main title of the project.

*Division Elements "div": Used to create containers for each marker, including cap and sleeve components.

*Structural Tags "head", "body": Organizing the document structure.

CSS Styling Highlights:

*CSS Colors: Extensively used CSS color properties to create gradients and shadow effects. This included RGB, RGBA, HEX, and HSL color models.

Layout and Design:

*Utilized .container class for a clean and centered layout of the markers.

*Implemented linear-gradient to create a visually appealing transition of colors on each marker.

*Box Model: Managed the dimensions and spacing (width, height, margin) of each marker element.

*Text Alignment: Centralized the heading for a balanced layout.

*Shadow Effects: Applied box shadows to give depth to the markers, enhancing their realism.

*Responsive Design: Ensured that the markers are well-displayed on different screen sizes.

Project Insights:

*Color Theory Application: This project was an excellent practice in applying color theory effectively in web design. The choice of 
colors and gradients made each marker distinct and visually striking.

*Understanding CSS Properties: Gained deeper understanding of CSS properties like background, box-shadow, and border.

*Practical Implementation: The project emphasized the practical implementation of CSS in creating real-world objects in a web environment.

Through this project, I have developed a stronger grasp of how to use CSS for creative design, particularly in using colors and shadows to add depth and aesthetics to web elements. It highlights my capability to implement complex CSS properties to bring designs to life.
